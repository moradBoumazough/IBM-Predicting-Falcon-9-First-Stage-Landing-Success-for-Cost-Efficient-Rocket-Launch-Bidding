# Project Overview:

In this project, we aim to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 


# Data Description:

The data for this project was collected from two sources: Space X API GET request and webscraping.


# Technical Overview:
1. Data Collection
2. Data wrangling
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Interactive visual analysis
5. Predictive analysis

# Results:

The models all had same accuracy of 0.83.

A higher flight number,  booster v1.1 and launch site KSC LC -39A are great ingredients for the successful launch of the first stage of Falcon9. The orbit and payload mass have varied effects on the success of launch depending on some other factors. More information can found in Report.pdf.
