## Project Overview
In this project, the goal is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage, crucial for cost-effective rocket launches. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches at $62 million, significantly lower than competitors due to stage reusability. Predicting landing success aids in launch cost determination, valuable for competitive bidding.

## Data Description
Data was sourced from two primary channels: Space X API through GET requests and web scraping.
